Use python to write latex documents (and eventually web pages)

## How this works

I have a nice file `example.tex` that compiles to `example.pdf`. But I'd rather
have a nice Python file `example.py` that compiles to `example.pdf`. For now, it
compiles to `generated.tex` and `generated.pdf` for comparison to my examples.
